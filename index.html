			<h1>Introduction</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container quote">We have been tasked with maintaining order. We consider it our primary objective to protect all citizens of Terran Mandate. We were struggling with that. We were in need of a new force… of a new warrior. <br> Warrior that would protect the Mandate from enemy within and without. Warrior of unmatched resolve. Warrior that could not be hurt by usual means. Warrior whose prowess would surpass all other. We are proud to say we have them now. <br>And we dub them – Men of Steel.</div>

		<div class="container">Hello, I’m happy you picked up this expansion to Stars without Number. What it does is that it provides you with modular powered armour to give your game more high-tech feel, should you feel that your campaign based on T4+ world needs it; perhaps you want to give your heroes edge so they can destroy waves of enemies and feel far more heroic, maybe you want to have invincible unit of space marines or you want to really distinguish the invasion force from far more advanced empire – in those cases, but many other, I’ve got you covered.</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp"><h2>How to treat armour</h2></div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			After you flip through the stats you will quickly discover that characters with access to the armour and few credits can get quite powerful. That is intentional. Because this kind of armour, would really give a great boost to any soldier that is skilled with using it. Armoured characters to unarmoured are supposed to feel like tanks to infantry.
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp"><h2>Systematic changes</h2></div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			So, what does it really do in terms of gameplay?
			<h3>Early-game</h3>
			<p>Armours can in the beginning give characters the most needed HP boost, if you forgo AC bonus and go for Armour HP. This way even pretty low-grade armour can help your lvl. 1 characters go through combat mission or battle scene without being one-shotted while still giving them feel the threat of death. (Low-grade plating hurts character piloting the armour each time they are hit. Giving them HP pool about 40 points but capacity to only take 5 hits.)</p>
<p>Also, (better) armour can serve as a plot-hook to an adventure the same way a ship or any other expensive or rare piece of equipment could.</p>
			<h3>Mid-game</h3>
			<p>Mid-game armours get access to some pretty interesting addons in terms of sensoric and auxiliary modules, convenient external addons and even powerful core systems.</p>
			<p>In terms of story, armour here feels like something that has not reached it’s full potential and is must-have in serious confrontations. Classic second act. It can be used as a prelude to third act as characters gather all necessary resources to either buy or construct their very own perfect piece to take-on the Big Bad.</p>
			<h3>End-game</h3>
			<p>The suits that are available here are quite powerful and come with core systems that can, especially in synergy with each other, really tip the balance of battlefield.</p>
			<p>In terms of story they are classic third act props. They are powerful, enemy minions are obliterated by them, unless with overwhelming numbers or cunning strategy, and can find their match only in the Big Bad.</p>
			<h3>Side-note</h3>
			<p>While serving all those things the armour can also serve as alternative levelling system, one that credits can be poured into in order to increase PC’s power level, system that can be run alongside normal levelling system and have the PCs obtain ‘real’ levels at much slower rate ending the campaign at level 4, for instance.</p>

			<h2>How to nerf armour</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>With that said, armour can also very easily disturb the balance in game. The way how to counter armoured characters being invincible as a GM is to have them face large forces of enemy, have enemy prepared with anti-armour weapons or to have them stand against another armoured unit.</p>
			<p>Also, though it depends on what world you build, I would highly recommend to consider these armours military only.</p>
			<p>So, they are great idea if your players are supposed to be military or swat unit, in that case they should mostly shear through enemy as hot knife through butter. (Great for beginner groups or RP based campaign.)</p>
			<p>In other case, I would recommand to severely limit access to and/or convenience of armour. (Local security force simply will not tolerate some crazy adventures with military grade weaponry.)</p>
			<p>But you should refrain from nerfing armour too much, it is supposed to feel empowering.
If you need to limit the armour in your campaign you can make it to simply not pay out for the PCs to run fully armoured heavy duty raid squad.</p>
			<p>This is why the deployment time and recharge cost are introduced. If the contract pays 1000 cr and PCs need to pay for 24 hour recharge time for four of their Legionary Mk. I armours (3840 cr), they are going to stop using this tactic fairly quickly.</p>
			<p>This also needs to be taken into account when designing adventures, that these armours will eat from the credits by their recharge cost.
This is reason why I would advise against giving the players Armour bay ship facility, mechanic of power cost fluctuation can be easily used to syphon credits from your PCs, should you feel they have too much. Or you can make energy cheaper, if they are struggling.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Type IV armours</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" id="last" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Type IV armours, fully explained later in rule section, rely heavily on energy shields. They require access to T4+ technology and are more expensive to buy and maintain than Type I and Type II armours, but shields recharge in between scenes. Also due to massive heat buildup and no way to dissipate heat, with no armour and external mounts, they will quite quickly shutdown in combat. Builds that aren’t made to minimalize heat cannot function longer than ten combat rounds.</p>
			<p>So, they’re alternative. More expensive one, but generally more powerful one that recharges in between scenes.</p>
