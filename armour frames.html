			<p>Ironskin armour frame is armour frame that covers all primitive armour. Each one looks different and could have different story – Ironskin armour can be armour found on T3+ worlds, it can be armour made of scrap on post-apocalyptic worlds, it could originally be any other armour frame patched so many times it has lost it’s original qualities.</p>
			<p>Due to being T0, this armour frame has no natural heat dispersion and adds 1 to all incoming damage.</p>

			<p>All armours in this series are designed with integrated powered armour system.</p>
			<p>Legionary armour frame series is designed specifically for military consumers. It is renowned for it’s heavy armour and integrated powered armour system, which is much cheaper than if bought separately.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Legionary mk. I (T4)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Legionary mk. I is basic combat armour, it can mount substantial amount of armour while it’s integrated powered armour system can offset it’s weight. It is widely spread among mercenaries but proper militaries usually favour it’s more advanced successor Legionary mk. II and III.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Legionary mk. II (T4)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Legionary mk. II is more advanced variant of mk. I, it can mount additional armour, has one available external mount and it’s power source went revision as well. Together with it’s succesor, Leginary mk. III, it is widely spread among military users, who enjoy possibility of integrated weaponry and reinforced armour.</p>

		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Legionary mk. III (T4)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>This armour frame was created by expanding mk. II’s tactical options, further armour mounts and exchange of rather weak Lux ChESs 1v5 power source for more powerful CS k5w80kj power source from Hamilridge & Collins Ind. Along with mk. II it is widely spread among military, with mk. III reserved for elite units.</p>

			<h3>Centurion (T4)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Centurion armour frame was specifically designed for officers, it sacrifices some armour for additional auxiliary slots, has sensoric slot and it’s CS k5w80kj was tweaked in order to rise it’s power output.</p>
			<p>Some models of this armour frame are made for parades and thus are either goldplated or made of some gold-like alloy.</p>

			<p>Olympus Ltd. produces one of the best mass produced combat armours available. They are made of cutting edge technology and often include psionic or alien technology.</p>
			<p>Titan and Zeus pilots are the few elite mercenary groups, shock troopers and special operatives. While Dreadnoughts are employed almost exclusively by planetary assault forces as fire support platforms. No matter the area of deployment, Olympus Ltd. armours are known to get the job done in no time.</p>

		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Titan armour frame (T4+)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Titan armour is the cheapest Olympus Ltd. armour. It boasts some external mounts for external weaponry or aiming aids, strong support frame for many layers of armour, some free space for both auxiliary modules and core systems. It’s power core, Megrez Fi – 384@16 t5 from Ursa Majoris Inc., one of the few examples of nuclear power core, is also very impressive.</p>
			<p>This power supply unit does not require to be recharged from external source, it is enough to let the armour rest to in order for it to recharge.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Zeus armour frame (T4+)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Zeus armour frames are usually custom made with gel filling their inside so they may perfectly fit their pilot. (The armour is treated as having Flexible mod from SwN core rulebook. This gel may be sculpted with no cost for new pilot by anyone who has at least fix 2.)</p>
			<p>This armour was created by further refining the concept of Titan armour. So much that this armour is pinnacle of what can armour this size achieve. It uses superconductors for most wiring, The heavy and insufficient Megrez Fi – 384@16-t5 was replaced by psionic Beta @302:<2;4> power source from Omega corporation which is far lighter and more powerful, though it cannot recharge on it’s own. The armour frame itself is made of psionic lightweight alloys unlike any other ever employed in an armour.</p>
			<p>Though this armour frame supports many armour layers it is best when operated with shields.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Dreadnough mk. I (T4)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>The first attempt of creating heavy fire support platform, Dreadnough mk. I, boasts enough external mounts to integrate considerable weaponry. The armour frame can support enough armour to make it tough nut to crack and sensoric slots can give the edge on the battlefield. Auxiliary slots can be used to store ammunition for the integrated weaponry so it can unleash hell onto enemy heads, while the free core systems can further empower the pilot.</p>
			<p>The whole behemoth is powered by Mizar-Alcor Fi/Fu 280@20-1t5 nuclear power core from the Ursa Majoris Inc., this power core does not need to be recharged from external power source, it is enough to let the armour sit idly and it will recharge.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Dreadnought mk. II (T4+)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp" id="last">
			<p>Mk. II was made by further improvements on the concept of the heavy fire support platform. Armour frame was further reinforced by new experimental alloys allowing for additional mounts, so much needed information is provided by expanded sensoric grid, inner cavity can hold further auxiliary modules thanks to extra room made by replacing Mizar-Alcor Fi/Fu 280@20-1t5 with smaller and more powerful psionic Beta @302:<2;4> from Omega corporation.</p>
			<p>This armour is distinct by fully enclosed cockpit with no helmet.</p>
