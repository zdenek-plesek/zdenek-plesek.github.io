		<div class="container quote">
			These armours, they’re great things. But they must be understood. They are delicate things with many systems, almost as another person. And they always need pair of skilled hands to keep them working.
		</div>
		<div class="container attributed">--excerpt from interview with chief engineer of Men of Steel project</div>
		<div class="container">Bringing these armours into your game means introducing few new rules. They are more than mere armours defined by AC, ENC and price. As stated above, they are almost as another character.</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h1>Special rules</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Psionic disturbance</h2>
			<p>Armour plating is pretty thick. Also the electronics, especially power core, create disturbance which prevents psychics inside from using any of their disciplines, unless the armour is converted to type III. (For details see next chapter.) The pilot (and armour) is also partially immune to some disciplines. (The pilot cannot choose to be affected.)</p>
			<table>

			Pilot is immune to any unmentioned technique.
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<ul>
				<li>Precognition
					<ul>
						<li>Oracle<br>If armour and it’s pilot is somehow present in the vision, armour manifests only as an outline, a shadow revealing no info about armour and pilot.</li>
						<li>Intuitive response<br>Pilot is treted as having automatic initiative success.</li>
						<li>Terminal reflection<br>Ambushes by armour wearers are revealed, but only as vague sense of immediate danger.</li>
						<li>Anguished vision<br>Armour wearer is fully affected.</li>
						<li>Prophecy<br>If target of prophecy is wearing armour at the time of ‘casting’, the ‘casting’ fails.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<ul>
				<li>
					Telekinesis
					<ul>
						<li>Telekinetic Armoury<br>Weapons affect armour and pilot as normal.</li>
						<li>Slip field<br>Armour wearer is fully affected.</li>
						<li>Tangible Force Construct<br>Armour (and it’s pilot) can pass if they succeed at difficulty 8 plus adept’s Telekinesis skill str/exert check.</li>
						<li>Telekinetic Ram<br>Armour wearer is fullz affected.</li>
						<li>Reactive telekinesis<br>Armour wearer is fully affected.</li>
					</ul>

		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<ul>
				<li>Telepathy<br>Requires use of Metapsionics Synthetic Adaptation technique to use any telepathic technique.
Transmit Though, Far Thought, Suppress Cognition, Reflex Response and Unity of Thought are too complex to be used through the armour’s disturbance, other can effect pilot fully.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<ul>
				<li>Teleportation<br>Inside of the armour is always fully immune against this discipline.
					<ul>
						<li>Burdened Apportation<br>Can be used onlz with Offensive Apportation fir willing targets.</li>
						<li>Stutterjump<br>As this technique affects caster, caster gains AC 20 even against armoured target.</li>
						<li>Offensive Apportation<br>Unwilling targets wearing armour cannot be affected.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">This rule is there to prevent psionics from becoming overpowered by wearing armour and to also give some shielding to pilots.</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Wearing and taking off armour</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Wearing armour with no-ones help is very difficult, requires dex/exert check at difficulty 9. If successful, wearing armour takes one hour. If unsuccessful, person is occupied for one hour constructing and dismantling steel prison around themselves, after that they may attempt again.</p>
			<p>If pilot is assisted, wearing armour takes an hour. Each assistant beyond first one lowers the time necessary by ten minutes.</p>
			<p>Wearing armour manually requires general tools such as electric screwdrivers, wrenches, precision screwdrivers and so on, full set of those tools must be available to every person assisting.</p>
			<p>Specialized facility, referenced in other equipment section, can be used to wear or take off armour in thirty seconds, ten with successful dex/exert check at difficulty 8.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Manage Special Action</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Person wearing armour can take new main action; Manage armour. With this action they may turn on/off or change power level of any single addon installed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Mounting addons</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p></p>Any skilled technician can mount any addon for cost 150 cr plus cost per addons installed, as in table. (These people are considered skilled with this kind of operation, they cannot fail.)</p>
<p>Any addon can also be installed with successful int/fix check, provided the pc has at least fix 0. With fix 2, check may be ignored, but installation time is doubled. If check is failed, the addon is destroyed.</p>

			<h2>Dismounting addons</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Addon can be dismounted by anyone with at least fix 0. Any dismounted addon is destroyed. If person has fix 4, they can attempt to dismount the addon with difficulty 12 int/fix check. If successful the addon survives and the same person can reinstall the addon somewhere else.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Targeting subsystems</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			External mounts, sensoric slots, auxiliary slots and core systems can be targeted, if the attacker can locate them. Attack is made at -2 penalty. If at least 5 points of damage are dealt the addon is damaged (not working) until repaired by difficulty 8 int/fix check, repair may be attempted only once.<br>
Subsystems can be targeted only if armour has no Shield HP.
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Heat signature reading</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>For each permanent heat production and dispersed heat, heat signature reading of armour is increased by one. Heat targeting weapons always target the object with the highest Heat signature.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Deployement time</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Armours have deployment time of 24 hours. Then they must be recharged. Full recharging cycle takes 24 hours. The next deployment time is equal to time armour spend recharging up to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Price for recharging may vary, based on local access to energy but base base price 10 cr per hour per each level of Power core rating. (It would cost cost 960 cr fully charge (24 hours) power core 4 armour frame.)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Specialized armours</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Some armours were made with specific purpose in mind and that is reflected in fact that there are addons integrated into the frame. Those addons cannot be removed or turned off, but their change to armour stat is already reflected in stats of the armour frame.</p>
<p>For instance, Legionary series of armour frame has always installed Powered armour system even though there is no room for Core system, but that means there is no <i>extra</i> room for additional system, power level of any addon installed this way can be increased, but may not be decreased beyond the point at which it is available at retail.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Painting</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Objects or characters can be ‘painted’, that means marked by invisible laser device. Painting is invisible without proper equipment. Painting lasts only as long as painting device is actively used to paint target. Some weapons have bonus to hit painted targets. Painted target also cannot hide to anyone with equipment that makes painting visible. Painting requires continuous clear line of sight.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Tagging</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Objects or characters can be ‘tagged’, that means marked by radioactive material. Without proper equipment tagging is invisible. Some weapons require tagging of target or have bonus to hit tagged target. Tagged targets cannot hide to anyone with equipment that makes tagging visible. Applying tag requires line of sight. Tag remains as long as tagging device is active, it no longer requires line of sight.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Handheld shields</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Unless stated otherwise, pilots of  <i>Men of Steel</i> power armour cannot use handheld shields.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h1>Armour frame</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			Every armour is defined by it's frame. Here's one example:

		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Name</h2>
			<p>The simplest part is a name. Every armour frame has a name, obviously, you want to somehow distinguish between them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Type</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>This stat defines what type of armour frame that is. There are multiple versions.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type 0</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Primitive, rug-tagged or jury rigged power armour. This armour type adds one to any incoming damage and it has no natural heat dispersion.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type I</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Classic power armour frame. Big and bulky.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type II</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Experimental extremely thin design, provides psi protection, but regular clothes can be worn on top. (In XXL size.)</p>
			<p>The cost of all installed addons is doubled. This represents their lightweight variants made of rare alloys or superconductors.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type III</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Always used as suffix to actual type (as Type I-III) of armour. Means that armour and all of it’s addons are converted to not disturb psionics.</p>
			<p>Total cost, armour frame and addons, is quadrupled for converted armour.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type IV</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Experimental design consisting of shield nodes distributed along body and of main chestpiece or belt. This design relies heavily on shield protection. It cannot provide environmental protection without shield. Type IV armours do not incapacitate pilot when in cooling mode.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type V</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Experimental design consisting of pseudo-fluid materials or nanomachines that can be stored within persons body and worn on a whim, manifesting itself from every wearer’s pore. Provides psi and environmental protection only when engaged.</p>
			<p>Whilist carried within body, maximises pilot's system strain.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h3>Type X</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Dreadnoughts. Towering five metres high structures that enclose pilot in cabin. They always come with weight support system, can ignore fall damage up to forty metres and can make use only of integrated weaponry. Integrated heavy weapons are considered as normal handheld weapons for pilot of this suit.</p>
			<p>Due to size of this armour frame, addons must be installed multiple times to be fully operational and as a result: price of any addon for this armour frame is tenfold.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>External mounts</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Mounts on the shoulders, wrists and other places of the body. Used to mount weaponry and other utility.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Armour mounts</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Reinforced mounts that connect to the strongest parts of the armour frame. These are the only mounts that allow for mounting plating and other heavy and large addons.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Sensoric slots</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Head located slots with access to data buses that feed directly into display overlay. Used to install sensoric equipment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Auxiliary slots</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Slots with access to power grid, data buses, heat conduction and crucial parts of the armour frame. Used to install various utility modules.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Core systems</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Space for installation very energy demanding systems that need direct access to power source, heat grid and main data bus of the armour as well as to other parts of the armour.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Power core</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>This stat says how much power is available within armour frame. Power source is irremovable part of the armour frame.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Base enc</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Encumbrance caused by armour frame itself. Most powered frames and lightweight variants have 0, while plain unpowered have 1. Type IV have encumbrance greater than 0, because it’s power core and frame are supported solely by pilot.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Price</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>All armour frames have price. This is unmodified price. It may vary according to circumstance.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h1>Armour ratings</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Armour also has some ratings, those are derived from the armour frame and the installed addons. These are actual stats that define the interactions with armour.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container table-container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>AC</th>
					<th>Full Enc</th>
					<th>Enc</th>

		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>AC</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Armour class. This is the armour class for attacking armour and anyone wearing it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Full Enc</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Full encumbrance. This is the real encumbrance of the armour. Should you weight it, or should armour at any point become unpowered, this is it’s encumbrance. It is gained by adding any weight caused by addons to enc rating of the armour frame.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Enc</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Encumbrance. This is the encumbrance caused by the armour. It is gained by subtracting power levels of Powered armour system from Full Enc.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Available energy</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>This is the energy available to the armour. The number is gained by adding power levels of Augmented power source to the Power core of the armour frame and subtracting any energy penalty introduced by installed addons.</p>
			<p>Available energy can never be lower than zero.</p>
			<p>It can be committed for the scene or for the turn.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Heat capacity</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Some equipment creates heat when used, armour can store some and then dispel part of it (see Heat dispersion rating) every turn.</p>
			<p>If heat reaches heat capacity rating, armour will emergency shutdown until cooled down. When in this state, actual heat dispersion is doubled, but armour will also lockdown, immobilizing pilot, and will provide no bonuses – any other than AC and HP from armour.</p>
			<p>Heat cannot exceed heat capacity at any point. (If heat capacity is required and armour has none, it is treated as having heat capacity 5.)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Actual heat dispersion</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Amount of heat dispersed every turn. Normally each armour has one. Type 0 armour has zero. AHD can be increased by addons.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Permanent heat production</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Amount of heat produced every turn as penalty by some addons. Permanent heat production can never exceed Actual heat dispersion.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Heat</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Heat currently in system.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Current heat dispersion</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>Amount of Heat that is dispersed every turn. This value is gained by subtracting Permanent heat dispersion from Actual heat dispersion. At the beginning of a turn: Current heat dispersion is subtracted from current Heat and the new value replaces the old Heat value.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Damage resistance</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>This value is reduced from any incoming damage, damage can never be lower than one.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Armour HP</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<p>HP of armour. Any incoming damage goes first into Shield HP then into Armour HP then into character HP. Armour HP can be repaired any time in a same way as drone. Bringing Armour to 0 HP doesn’t introduce any penalties, it represents only plating.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container heading revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp">
			<h2>Shield HP</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container revealOnScroll" data-animation="fadeInUp" id="last">
			<p>HP of shields. Any incoming damage goes first into Shield HP then into Armour HP then into character HP. Shield HP lasts only for duration of scene. Bringing shields to 0 HP doesn’t introduce any penalties, it represents only manifested force.</p>
